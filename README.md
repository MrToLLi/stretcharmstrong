stretcharmstrong
================

jQuery Plugin for HTML Background Resizing and Slide Show

What this plugin does;-

- Resizes images whilst maintaining aspect ratio
- Provides slide show functionality for images/content with 'fx' options e.g. 'slide' or 'fade'

Features;-

- Easy implementation
- Can be used as backgrounds or in the document flow
- Works in 'responsive' sites (as long as parent wrapper is 'fluid')
- Built-in methods for slide show controls
- Cross browser compatible (tested on Chrome, Firefox, IE7-10)

Usage;

- Initialise stretcharmstrong with default settings like so;


  $('div#wrapping-element').stretcharmstrong();


- You can set some options and callbacks like so (these are defaults);

  $('div#wrapping-element').stretcharmstrong({
    // options
    'rotate'     : false,                             
    'interval'   : 5000,                              
    'transition' : 'fade',                            
    'duration'   : 1000,                              
    'element'    : 'img',                             
    'background' : true,                              
    // callbacks
    transition_complete : function(event) {
      console.log(this);                                  
    },                                                                   
    cycle_complete : function() {},
    rotate_changed : function(event) {}    
  });

Explantion of options
---------------------

rotate     : rotate images? true or false 
interval   : the rotate interval in miliseconds 
transition : the transition type for the rotate ('fade' or 'slide') 
duration   : the transition duration in miliseconds 
element    : the element type (semantically) to be worked with  
background : use as background or inline (true or false) 
 
Explantion of callbacks
-----------------------
 
transition_complete : fires when an element has been transitioned passing event data as follows;- 
  - transition : the transition type 
  - direction  : which direction the slide came from (if transition is slide) 
  - index      : the index of the image being transitioned in 
   
  - 'this' is a reference to the image being transitioned in 
    
cycle_complete : fires when all elements have been transitioned  
 
rotate_changed : fires when the rotation interval has been stopped or started passing event data as follows;- 
  - rotate : 'resumed' or 'paused'
